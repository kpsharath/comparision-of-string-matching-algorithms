# Comparision of String Matching Algorithms

String matching is the problem of finding all
occurrences of a character pattern in a text. This project
provides an overview of different string matching
algorithms and comparative study of these algorithms. In
this project, we have evaluated several algorithms, such as
Brute Force algorithm, Rabin-Karp algorithm, Boyer
Moore algorithm, Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, Horspool
algorithm. We analyzed the core ideas of these single
pattern string matching algorithms. We compared the
matching efficiencies of these algorithms by searching
speed, pre - processing time, matching time and the key
ideas used in these algorithms. It is observed that
performance of string matching algorithm is based on
selection of algorithms and also on the type of text and
pattern matching.
